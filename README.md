### **Project Name**:
**"Automated 4.0 Factory Simulation with TIA Portal and Factory IO"**

### **Project Description**:
This project involves the design and implementation of an automated control and performance evaluation system for a virtual 4.0 factory. The system integrates TIA Portal V17 and Factory IO to simulate and control the production of three types of ceramic products (tiles, plates, and cups). A modular GRAFCET design is employed to manage the production process via Siemens PLCs, while PLCSIM is used for virtual automation testing. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as production rate, product non-conformance, and average production time are monitored through a user-friendly HMI interface for real-time performance visualization.
